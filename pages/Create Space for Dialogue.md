- You have the authority or esteem to be able to set the agenda for meetings of groups of people, such as at a conference talk or workshop, a community group or workplace.
- ## Problem
	- One of the ways patriarchy sustains itself is by discouraging people from talking about it (see [[Speak its name]] ). This makes it hard for people to learn about what it is, its impacts, and to decide what they want to do about it.
- ## Forces/tensions
	- Topics on patriarchy and feminism may be regarded as "too controversial" or "too political" to be accepted as conference sessions. (See [[Ride a Trojan Horse]]).
	- These conversations can be hard, requiring emotional work from the participants.
	- **But**
		- Unless there is space for us to [[Listen and learn]] from each other, nothing will change.
- ## Solution
	- Use the influence to propose conference workshops, community meetup-up workshops or workspace brown-bag sessions where you raise the subject of patriarchy, provide some basic framing on the subject, and allow for dialogue between those who are impacted by it.
- ## Consequences
	- Simply proving a space for women and other minorities to [[Tell stories] about what they've had to go through has been described as "cathartic".
	- For men, it can be enlightening to hear what those who are subjugated by the patriarchy have to go through every day.
- ## Examples
	- At Agile Open Canada in Banff 2023, I proposed a rotating "park bench" panel session entitled "Women Complain, and Men Listen". Only people identifying as women were allowed on the panel (unless they invited a man up to speak) and the panel discussed various questions from the audience about what it's like to experience sexism and discrimination at work.

- ## Related Patterns
	- Within the spaces we've created, we can [[Speak its name]] to increase awareness, and [[Tell Stories]] to create shared understanding, empathy and insight.
	- You may need to use a [[Ride a Trojan Horse]] to get permission, or [[Find your own Allies]] who can help you to get a platform.
