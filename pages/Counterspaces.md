## Problem
	- People in marginalized groups can feel isolated and can find it hard to make sense of unfair experiences, especially within a prevailing culture that professes itself to be meritocratic.
- ## Forces/tensions
	- These are often contentious spaces, as people from more dominant groups tend to see these as the very definition of "exclusive."
- ## Solution
	- The solution is to create safe spaces where people with similar experiences can compare notes, spot patterns, vent, and troubleshoot together
- ## Consequences
- ## Examples
	- Affinity groups
