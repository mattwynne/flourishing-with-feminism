## Contributing

* Clone the repository with git
* Download the [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/downloads) desktop app
* Open the folder you cloned using `Add new graph` in the LogSeq menu

Under `Settings` / `Version control` you can enable settings to have LogSeq commit to git automatatically, or on other cadences.

There'a a `Git` plugin in the plugins marketplace you can use to push/pull from buttons on the LogSeq desktop app.
