## Problem
	- Plenty of organizations have inclusion initiatives or diversity as a value, but a lot of the time these are experienced by people in the organization as theater or worse, a smokescreen to shield non-inclusive practices ("we can be discriminatory! Diversity is a value of ours!!")
	- The same is true on a personal scale. Many people want to think of themselves as inclusive, but they may not want it *enough* to get uncomfortable and identify where their behavior is experienced as exclusionary or biased
