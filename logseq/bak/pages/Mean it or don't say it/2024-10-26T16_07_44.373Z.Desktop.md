## Problem
	- Plenty of organizations have inclusion initiatives or diversity as a value, but a lot of the time these are experienced by people in the organization as theater or worse, a smokescreen to shield non-inclusive practices ("we can be discriminatory! Diversity is a value of ours!!")
	- The same is true on a personal scale. Many people want to think of themselves as inclusive, but may not be willing to do the feedback gathering and inner work to line up their intention to their actions to how they are experienced by others.
- ## Solution
	- Mean it or don't say it. Don't start an initiative you can't carry through. Don't appoint a senior diversity leader and then disempower them. Don't list diversity as a value unless you know what other things you might be willing to trade off to make it happen.
