## Problem
	- Many people in marginalized groups have been asked many times what they need to flourish. And then it doesn't happen. And then they get asked again. This puts the marginalized folks in a perpetual position of educator without seeing progress or benefits. There's an additional cost beyond time to asking, it often treads on painful ground and risks retraumatizing the interviewee. Ultimately this destroys trust.
	- Sometimes prior answers are dismissed because they're too hard or because they don't line up with what the person in power actually wants to do (or thinks will work).
- ## Solution
	- The labor of understanding should shift to people in a position of more power. If there are already resources out there that answer your questions, find them and really work to understand to them. Only when you've put in the work to get as far as you can should you go back to the people with the painful lived experience
