- Vision is still to write a book about this
- Next tangible big goal would be to get a paper into PLoP next year
- What are the next steps towards that goal?
	- We said we would research and build on the good work of other people in this area
- What's our scope? Software only? Workplaces only? Isn't the workplace itself a patriarchal concept? Should we just burn it all down?
	- Validate our observations in the world outside of software
	- We're going to have to burn it all down eventually, but in the meantime we need to try things and see what works. Unify around what we're learning.
- How much time do we have for this?
	- Deadline helped
	- [[Create Space for Dialogue]]
	- Meeting more frequently?
- Potential tasks
	- Flesh out existing patterns
	- Publish what we've got, eg. google docs? so we could get feedback
	- What do we want to know from experts?
- Experts?
	- Who has written books about (true) feminism in the workplace? (i.e. not *Lean In*) [[Prior Art]]
		- Kate Raworth's Donut Economics
		- https://sister.is/selling/the-proposals
		- [[Jo Stansfield]]
	- People who have written about [[Equitable Design]]
