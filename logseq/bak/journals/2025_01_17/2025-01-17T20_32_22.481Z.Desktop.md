- Vision is still to write a book about this
- Next tangible big goal would be to get a paper into PLoP next year
- What are the next steps towards that goal?
	- We said we would research and build on the good work of other people in this area
- What's our scope? Software only? Workplaces only? Isn't the workplace itself a patriarchal concept? Should we just burn it all down?
	- Validate our observations in the world outside of software
	- We're going to have to burn it all down eventually, but in the meantime we need to try things and see what works. Unify around what we're learning.
- How much time do we have for this?
	- Deadline helped
	- There's a missing pattern around creating space for change. How do you do that when you're busy
- Potential tasks
	- Flesh out existing patterns; get stuff out of our heads
	- Publish what we've g
	- Think about and list questions we'd have for an expert
