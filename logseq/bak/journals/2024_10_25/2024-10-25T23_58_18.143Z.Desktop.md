	- I suggest you start by writing up a 2 page summary of the goals of the workshop, the prompts you had us respond to...and what you 2 learned from the workshop..and what (if you do have any) plans for what you might follow up on ...based on the workshop
	- My suggestion is for you to write something quickly (don't worry about format yet)...send it to me and we'll iterate. I kind of think that this report should be like what I might write in an informative blog post...
